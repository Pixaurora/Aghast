# Aghast

Aghast is a small Ornithe mod meant to fix Ghasts in multiplayer for Beta 1.7.3.

This mod fixes the following 2 issues:
- Ghasts don't make a sound when they shoot
- Ghasts do not have the model growth/shrink animation when shooting

It plays the sound the way release 1.0 plays it, so it even helps clients that connect through a compatability layer, such as ViaFabricPlus!
